								    <p> THIS IS A COORDINATE SYSTEM!
Descartes did not have bases; Beklemishev had bases. He was told that this was not good, but, as I was told, it was impossible to convince him.</p> 
									<p> So your underwater earthquake happened, there is a tsunami wave going ashore and you know what the most important question is: does this same wave function belong to C2?</p>
                                    <p>As a child, I thought that I spoke Russian, but it turned out - this is not so.</p>
									<p> These are equations of mathematical physics, worse does not happen anymore ...</p>
									<p> Student: Why is the “X” squared?
VV: By mistake. You know, it happens by theorem, by lemma, and by mistake.</p>
								<p>You know, this canonical approach like “there is a function, let's do something with it” ended up in the fact that Chernobyl was blown up. </p>
<p>For a very long time, a person who discovered complex numbers was not recognized. He did everything, but since he could not explain to people what to do, they looked at him with suspicion. </p>
<p> You know, in mathematics there is either exists, or for anyone. Everything else is from the evil one.</p>
<p> Big people prefer not to stoop to such details. It’s like a giraffe grass is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Who does not work will die out. </p>
<p>If you see that a person does not have common sense, then he will go for a retake until he finds it. </p>	
<p>MSU graduates know everything, but they don’t know how to do it.
MSTU graduates can do everything, but they don’t understand anything at all.
Therefore, it was necessary to create PhysTech half a century ago in order to train people to be able to do both. </p>
<p> My father went to the front with Khokhl, and returned to Russian.</p>
<p> Empires are destroyed by Asians because the White Man does not want to work.</p>
<p>“The strictness of laws in the Russian Federation is compensated by the non-bindingness of their implementation” - in reflections on the then introduced BRS. </p>
<p> There is one very important rule at PhysTech: there are no rules. It’s like fighting without rules. Therefore, write a control!</p>
<p> - Tell me, is anyone in your group already crazy?
--Not.
--Very bad. This means that you do not study the material well enough. You need to study the material so that you feel on the verge. Now, if you feel so-so, it means that everything is in order with your studies.</p>							
<p>Physicists are completely indifferent; they differentiate anyone. </p>
<p>FizTech is an institution where the rules of the game are always unknown. </p>
<p>- Which of you has ever been to a retake?
(two people raised a hand)
-Total two? And the rest do not even imagine what PhysTech is ... </p>
<p> But please learn this out of respect for Lagrange.</p>
<p> The fact that the Russians are swearing suggests that it is an emotional nation. That is female.</p>
<p> In general, develop the ability to see through.</p>
