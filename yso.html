								    <p>Modern astrophysics has revealed that stars in the night sky are not eternal. 
									They start their lifecycle from a diffuse low dense cloud in the cold and dark interstellar medium. 
									Depending on the chemical composition of prestellar phase two scenarios are possible. 
									In a cloud abundant with carbon (C) atoms, or so-called Warm Carbon Chain Chemistry (WCCC) scenario, 
									it leads to the formation of carbon chain molecules at the fast free fall timescale collapse. 
									And in a cloud abundant with carbon monoxide (CO) molecules, or Hot Corino (HC) scenario, 
									complex organic molecules are formed through the slow collapse process. 
									In the conditions of UV radiation dense cores appearance favors further gravitational collapse. </p> 
									<p>Protostars are categorized in terms of the spectral energy distribution of their surrounding dust material. 
									Very young protostars, or so-called Class 0 objects, are mainly in the accretion phase 
									and are believed to have rich “envelope” material whose mass is greater than the stellar mass. 
									The envelope medium absorbs light from the central object and reradiates the emission mainly at sub-mm wavelengths, 
									being completely shielded in visible light. </p>
									<p>Physical properties of young protostars have not been well studied because they are deeply embedded in dense molecular cloud cores, 
									heavily obscured by the envelope material, and rare due to their short dynamical lifetimes. 
									Observations of spectral lines at radio, sub-mm and infrared wavelengths are a powerful means 
									to investigate physical and chemical conditions in a gas of astronomical sources. 
									The Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA), the biggest “compound eye” at mm and sub-mm wavelength, 
									is the most powerful tool to see accreting stars inside. Using ALMA both "continuum emission" and "molecular line emission" spectra are observed. </p>
									<p>Chemical diversity in star forming regions is known and different commonly observed gas molecules trace regions 
									with different physical/chemical conditions. Sulfur monoxide (SO) molecules are often observed in regions with shocked gas, 
									where accreting stars soak their surrounding gas and produce molecular outflows (jets). 
									They are expected to trace a centrifugal barrier, i.e., a boundary between an envelope and a disk of WCCC sources 
									and may stand out as a new probe for studying. 
									Rotational transitions of molecules are a suitable footprint for the spectral line surveys at mm/sub-mm wavebands.  </p>
									<p>Observational data sets are available from ALMA surveys at 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum with 17 GHz resolution 
									and two molecular line emission spectra of SO rotational transitions (J<sub>N</sub>=5<sub>6</sub>-4<sub>5</sub> & J<sub>N</sub>=6<sub>7</sub>-5<sub>6</sub>). 
									The lower transition has frequency ≈ 220 GHz and the observational data with better velocity resolution but worse spacial resolution, 
									whereas the higher transition has frequency ≈ 260 GHz providing with the observational data of better spacial but worse velocity resolution. 
									In this project SO molecular line emission is observed and classified for the case of Class 0/1 transient protostar IRAS 15398-3559. 
									The target is denoted to be a WCCC source located in Lupus 1 cloud in the main filament structure at a distance of ≈ 150 pc, 
									with a mass ≈ 0.01 M<sub>⊙</sub> (of solar mass) at the systemic velocity V<sub>sys</sub> ≈ 5.2 km/s.</p>
									
									<p>When observing an astronomical source we may be looking through a cloud of matter which lies along the line of sight. 
									As a beam of radiation travels through a medium, it loses energy to absorption, gains energy by emission, and redistributes energy by scattering processes. 
									Each of these will change a source’s apparent intensity. Optical depth (thickness) is a measure of absorbed/transmitted radiant power through a material 
									and is an increasing function of optical path length (distance over which a beam propagates). 
									A medium is said to be optically thick (opaque) if on average a photon cannot pass through it without absorption. 
									Conversely, a transparent medium is said to be optically thin. This property is a function of wavelength (frequency). 
									If a source is optically thin, its emission appears weaker (lower intensity) than if it was optically thick.  </p>
									<p>The temperature of a radio source is frequently a quantity of physical interest. 
									The brightness temperature T<sub>b</sub> is the temperature of a black body in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. 
									It characterizes radiation, and depending on its mechanism can differ considerably from the real physical temperature T<sub>kin</sub>. 
									For a thermal source T<sub>kin</sub> ≥ T<sub>b</sub>. 
									They might be equal for an opaque source, but for a semitransparent thermal source (like the Earth's atmosphere) T<sub>b</sub> < T<sub>kin</sub>.
									The temperature within a system in internal thermodynamic equilibrium (TE) state is spatially uniform, 
									matter and radiation are in equilibrium with each other at the same temperature T<sub>kin</sub>, absorption and emission processes are balanced. 
									Such equilibrium radiation at temperature T<sub>kin</sub> is isotropic and has a blackbody spectrum. The vast majority of physical systems found in nature, however, 
									are not in TE and are a subject to flux of matter and energy, including chemical reactions, non-equilibrium potentials (driving forces), phase changes.</p>
									<p>To understand thermodynamical properties of the observed medium T<sub>b</sub> maps are analized 
									in two SO molecular line emission and in the continuum emission spectra. 
									In all cases T<sub>b</sub> values appeared to be below 2 K. Despite a single SO molecule transition between two rotational states 
									with a subsequent photon emission requires temperature ≈ 10 K, at such temperatures SO molecules stick to dust grains 
									and do exist in a gas phase only at temperatures higher than 50 K, also named the excitation temperature (T<sub>ex</sub> ≈ 50 K). 
									These considerations may suggest that the observed emission is optically thin (optical depth << 1) and the source is a semitransparent medium.</p>
									
									<p>In order to provide constraints on physical conditions of the gas, such as density and T<sub>kin</sub>, 
									the observed SO line intensities and ratios are compared with the predictions of a statistical equilibrium radiative transfer code RADEX, 
									a part of the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA). RADEX calculates strengths (intensities) of atomic and molecular lines 
									produced in a uniform medium of interstellar clouds which are assumed to be isothermal and homogeneous without large-scale velocity fields. 
									Optical depth effects are treated with an escape probability formulation involving collisional and radiative processes 
									describing more realistic media with complex multiple scattering.
									Since the observational data of the species has only two observed molecular lines (one intensity ratio) 
									physical conditions can not be resolved into medium density and T<sub>kin</sub>, and assumption on the gas temperature has to be made. 
									Thus, physical conditions are reported for the two extreme cases in the scope of Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics approach: 
									so-called Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) and Non-local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NON-LTE) assumptions.</p>
									<p>The concept of LTE means that a system can be spatially and temporally divided into cells, 
									large enough to be considered as macroscopic systems and small enough to fulfill TE conditions inside each cell to good approximation. 
									Matter and energy may pass freely between contiguous cells but slowly enough to leave them in respective individual equilibria. 
									One can think of two relaxation times separated by an order of magnitude: the time for a macroscopic dynamical system to change 
									and the time for a single cell to reach its equilibrium. 
									In LTE model the main role in processes is played by molecule collisions. 
									As a result of multiple collisions and energy exchange, a certain static energy distribution of all molecules 
									in some neighborhood about a given point is established. 
									Moreover, collisions occur so often that with any perturbation the corresponding Maxwell–Boltzmann molecular velocity distribution 
									for a certain temperature in each small locality is restored almost instantly 
									and practically sustained allowing to determine the temperature through a number of emitted photons by excited molecules. 
									The key to LTE is that the rate of collisions of ponderable matter particles such as molecules 
									should far exceed the rates of creation and annihilation of photons. LTE is achieved in the high-density limit (at the critical density) 
									corresponding to T<sub>kin</sub> ≈ T<sub>ex</sub> ≈ 50 K.</p>
									<p>LTE assumption is, however, a poor approximation for a fairly extensive class of systems and processes. 
									These conditions are unfulfilled, for example, in very rarefied gases, in which molecular collisions are infrequent. 
									For a dilute gas of astronomical sources NON-LTE assumption is applied that implies higher temperature values. 
									In the range reasonable for young accreting 0/1 Class protostars in adiabatic phase the estimates are provided at T<sub>kin</sub> ≈ 200 K. 
									In both LTE and NON-LTE approximations SO molecular abandances (≈ 1 SO molecule per 10<sup>8</sup> molecules) and column densities were assessed. 
									</p>
									<p>To investigate kinematical behavior position-velocity diagrams were used. 
									Previously reported data identified that the protostar exhibits signatures of dominant infall motion with high accretion rate 
									and envelope rotation with low constant angular momentum. 
									The recent data set with higher spacial resolution has revealed a velocity gradient. 
									By measuring a rotational profile in SO J<sub>N</sub>=6<sub>7</sub>-5<sub>6</sub> molecular line, Keplerian rotation has been identified for the first time. 
									The results are consistant with existing kinematic models and prove that SO molecules can trace dynamics of WCCC sources. </p>
