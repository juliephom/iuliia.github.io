									Computational Materials Design outlines a wide range of materials design technologies 
									from first-principle calculations to continuum mechanics, 
									with successful applications to materials design and development. 
									Main goals include discovering new materials, determining materials behavior and mechanisms, 
									explaining experiments, and exploring materials phenomena and theories. 
									It is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that uses 
									advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. 
									At its core it involves the development of models and simulations of natural systems.
									Materials simulation methods span all length scales, from electrons to components.
									Due to the balance of computational cost and predictive capability, 
									density functional theory (DFT) has the most significant use in materials science. 
									DFT most often refers to the calculation of the lowest energy state of the system,
									however, molecular dynamics (atomic motion through time) can be run with DFT computing forces between atoms.

			Neptune's theory of diamond rains has been around for more than three decades. 
			Hydrocarbon (an organic chemical compound composed exclusively of hydrogen and carbon atoms) reactions and diamond precipitates 
			in the internal structure of ice giants are widely discussed in the scientific literature. 
			It is believed that inside celestial bodies such simple hydrocarbons as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), 
			which prevails in the atmosphere of Neptune and causes its distinct blue shade, undergoes structural changes, 
			during which hydrogen is released from the inner layers of the ice giant. 
			In the intermediate layers, methane is first transformed into a mixture of hydrocarbon polymers, 
			and in the deeper layers, the process of separation into diamond and hydrogen is possible.

<div class="desc text-justify">  <p>Back to the late 90s, necessary laboratory conditions for the formation of diamond crystals from methane, 
			reproducing a state of ≈ 10,000 km below the surface of Neptune, were recreated. 
			In a later experiment, a proof of the phase separation process was first observed on a real time basis 
			by means of in-situ X-ray diffraction of a few femtoseconds’ (10<sup>-15</sup> seconds) pulses.</p>
			<p>Neptune is the furthest planet from the Sun, however, its internal energy is enough to generate the fastest supersonic winds in the solar system. 
			It emits 2.61 times more energy than receives from the Sun. 
			The heat flux of Neptune [J/m<sup>2</sup>] generated by an internal source is enormous. 
			Until now, a heating mechanism is unknown exactly. Several possible explanations were proposed, 
			including radioactive heating by the planet core, convection flows, as well as dissociation of methane into other hydrocarbon chains. 
			However, all attempts to theoretically explain the heat flux of Neptune give underestimated assessments. 
			At the same time, the reaction of phase separation of methane into diamond and hydrogen (CH<sub>4</sub> → C +2H<sub>2</sub>) is endothermic, 
			which introduces even greater discrepancy. 
			Nevertheless, it is possible to assume other reactions occurring in the bowels of Neptune, 
			which are more consistent with the thermal balance of the planet.</p>
			<p>In the above context, this work is devoted to the melting curve calculation of polymeric carbonic acid 
			in the pressure range of 44 – 240 GPa by statistical analysis method of molecular dynamics simulations 
			for small size coexisting phases from first principles. For the first time, this method was applied to study organic compounds. 
			Its advantages and disadvantages in relation to the specified substance are considered. 
			Through extensive optimization of computation parameters for a utilized cluster architecture, 
			the melting curve was obtained for an adequate number of pressure-temperature points. </p>	</div>

                                    <p>Reaching the next level in any technological process requires new materials with new exceptional properties. 
									Until recently, the majority of new materials were discovered either incidentally or through trial and error what was unproductive and expensive. 
									The rapid development of Computational Materials Science began only with the introduction of the evolutionary USPEX algorithm, 
									one of the most powerful methods that can predict materials with any given and even extreme properties under various conditions. 
									The main state-of-the-art algorithm incorporates "learning from history", which is done through the selection of the best structures 
									to become "parents" of a new generation, survival of the fittest structures, and variation operators 
									(i.e., recipes for producing "child structures" from parents). 
									Acting upon good structures, variation operators lead, with high probability, to yet other better structures.</p>
									
									<p>Nowadays, microprocessors are used as a computational element in everything 
									from the smallest recessed systems and mobile devices to enormous mainframes and supercomputers. 
									Their most important property is the clock frequency [MHz]. It characterizes the performance of a computer and indicates 
									how many elementary operations a microprocessor runs in one second. 
									Increase in the performance of integrated circuits (ICs) over the past few decades for the most part has been achieved 
									due to increasing a transistor’s speed, decreasing its size and packaging more transistors on one chip. 
									The factor that breaks this trend is the slowing down the signal spread in a chip. 
									Signal delays increase with each generation of scaling and limit the overall performance of an integrated circuit.</p>
									
									
									<p>Dielectrics with low dielectric constant are necessary to reduce mutual capacitances of conductors inside a chip, 
									reducing the time constant of RC-chains and contributing to the improvement of performance and the decrease of energy consumption. 
									The purpose of this study, carried out by computational design methods was the prediction of new materials 
									with permittivity lower than that of currently used silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2</sub> (ε = 4,0). 
									In the present work systems based on molecular compositions BeF<sub>2</sub>, (BeF<sub>2</sub>)×(SiO<sub>2</sub>), 
									(B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)×(SiO<sub>2</sub>) were investigated. 
									The USPEX algorithm combined with the Quantum Mechanical Calculation Package VASP were utilized 
									to receive relaxed structures with the locally optimized enthalpy and 
									to compute their dielectric matrixes within Density Functional Theory. 
									In the result of this work, new materials with low dielectric constant, 
									which have a potential to be successfully implemented in microelectronics to prevent large capacities, were predicted.</p>
