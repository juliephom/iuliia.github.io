									Computational Materials Design outlines a wide range of materials design technologies 
									from first-principle calculations to continuum mechanics, 
									with successful applications to materials design and development. 
									Main goals include discovering new materials, determining materials behavior and mechanisms, 
									explaining experiments, and exploring materials phenomena and theories. 
									It is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that uses 
									advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. 
									At its core it involves the development of models and simulations of natural systems.
									Materials simulation methods span all length scales, from electrons to components.
									Due to the balance of computational cost and predictive capability, 
									density functional theory (DFT) has the most significant use in materials science. 
									DFT most often refers to the calculation of the lowest energy state of the system,
									however, molecular dynamics (atomic motion through time) can be run with DFT computing forces between atoms.

Reaching the next level in any technological process requires new materials with new exceptional properties.
Until recently, most new materials were discovered either incidentally or through trial and error that was
unproductive and expensive. The rapid development of Computational Materials Science began only with the
introduction of the evolutionary USPEX algorithm, one of the most powerful methods that can predict
materials with any given and even extreme properties under various conditions. The main state-of-the-art algorithm incorporates “learning
from history”, which is done through selection of the best structures to become parents of the new
generation, survival of the fittest structures, and variation operators (i.e., recipes for producing child
structures from parents). Acting upon good structures, variation operators lead, with high probability, to yet
other better structures. </p>

<p>Nowadays microprocessors are used as a computational element in
everything from the smallest recessed systems and mobile devices to enormous
mainframes and supercomputers. The most important their property is the clock
frequency (MHz). It characterizes the performance of a computer and indicates
how many elementary operations a microprocessor runs in one second. Increase
in the performance of integrated circuits (ICs) over the past few decades for the
most part has been achieved due to increasing a transistor speed, decreasing its
size and packaging more transistors on one chip. The factor that breaks this
trend is a speed of slowing of the signal spread in a chip. Signal delays increase
with each generation of scaling and limit the overall performance of an integrated
circuit.
</p>
<p>Dielectrics with a small dielectric constant are necessary to reduce
mutual capacitances of conductors inside a chip, reducing the time constant of
RC-chains and contributing the improvement of performance and the decrease of
energy consumption. The purpose of this study, carried out by computational
design methods was the prediction of new materials with a permittivity lower
than that of currently used silicon dioxide SiO2 (ε = 4,0).</p>
<p>In the present work the molecular combination systems based on BeF2 and B2O3, (BeF2)x-(SiO2)y,
(B2O3)x-(SiO2)y, were investigated. The USPEX algorithm combined with the
quantum chemical calculation package VASP were used to predict crystal
structures of isolators having a very small dielectric constant. To find the most optimal
stoichiometry of a multicomponent compound the "variable composition"
method was used. The number of atoms in a unit cell varied from 9 to 18. The
first population of each calculation was randomly generated using a symmetry
algorithm; second population structures were generated using evolutionary
operators and the random symmetry algorithm in the following proportions:
heredity operator (50%), softmutation operator (10%), permutation operator
(10%) and random generation structures (30%). In subsequent generations a ratio 
of operators was chosen by the USPEX algorithm. To calculate local optimization
in entalphy of a structure Density Functional Theory was used. 
To receive relaxed structures and their dielectric matrixes an approximate solution to the
many-body Schrödinger equation was computed within Density Functional Theory. Interaction
between ions and valence electrons was described by wave functionals with a
maximum energy of 550 eV. In the Brillouin zone a uniform grid centered at Γ-
point with a maximum resolution of 2π × 0.085 Å was constructed. </p>
<p> From each calculation structures with the lowest dielectric constant were
selected. Then hardness was calculated and thermal stability with the coefficient
of thermal expansion were estimated. Further the energy stability of these
compounds was determined by comparing a structure enthalpy with the enthalpy
of its components. Finally, a list of hard and energetically stable structures was
compiled. New materials with a low dielectric constant, which can be potentially successfully
employed in microelectronics to prevent large capacities, in the result of this work were
predicted.
